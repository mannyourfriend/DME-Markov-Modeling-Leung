This model was made by simulating costs of different treatments over the course of 2 or 17 years of treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), the leading cause of non-congenital blindness in the United States.
To better understand how a new treatment method compared to typical measures taken by ophthalmologists for treating this disease, this code was developed. Using aggregated statistical data from the Vestrum Retinal Health Database, I modeled annual costs for 100,000 individuals, including direct medical treatment, caretaker costs, and quality of life improvement. The final paper has not yet been published but is currently being reviewed by the Journal for Vitreoretinal Diseases.
